                </p>
                <h3>1. Roof Installation and Replacement</h3>
                <p>
                    We provide expert installation using premium materials if your home requires a new roof or a complete replacement. We work with a variety of roofing systems, including:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Asphalt shingles:</b> A popular and cost-effective option known for durability and a wide range of styles. Asphalt shingles offer excellent weather resistance and are available in various colors and textures, making them a versatile choice for many homeowners.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Tile roofing:</b> Ideal for those seeking longevity and a distinct aesthetic appeal. Tile roofs are particularly suited for warmer climates, as they reflect heat and improve energy efficiency. Our durability makes them a lasting investment.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Metal roofing:</b> A durable, energy-efficient solution that offers exceptional weather resistance. Metal roofs are known for longevity, with lifespans often exceeding 50 years. We also require minimal maintenance, making them a practical option for homeowners looking for long-term reliability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Our team thoroughly assesses your home’s structure and provides recommendations based on your specific needs, budget, and style preferences.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Roof Repairs</h3>
                <p>
                    Even minor roofing issues, such as missing shingles or small leaks, can lead to significant damage if left unaddressed. Avalon Roofing Services offers prompt and thorough repair services to protect your home. Our technicians are trained to identify and fix a range of problems, including:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Leaks and water damage:</b> Roof leaks can lead to mold growth, wood rot, and interior water damage. Our team identifies the source of the leak and provides effective repairs to prevent further issues.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Damaged or missing shingles:</b> Strong winds, rain, and aging can cause shingles to crack, curl, or fall off. We replace damaged shingles to maintain your roof’s protective barrier.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Cracked or deteriorated flashing:</b> Flashing is essential for sealing roof joints and preventing water infiltration. Damaged flashing can compromise your roof’s waterproofing, making timely repairs critical.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Storm-related roof issues:</b> Hail, heavy rain, and wind can cause structural damage. We offer fast, reliable repair services to restore your roof’s integrity after storms.</li>

                </p>
                <h3>3. Roof Maintenance</h3>
                <p>
                    Routine maintenance is key to prolonging the life of your roof. Regular inspections and upkeep help identify potential issues early, preventing costly repairs. Our maintenance services include:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Comprehensive roof inspections:</b> We thoroughly examine your roof for signs of wear, such as cracked shingles, damaged flashing, or weakened areas.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Gutter cleaning and debris removal:</b> Clogged gutters can lead to water pooling on your roof, causing deterioration. We clear debris to ensure proper drainage.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Shingle and flashing assessments:</b> We check for loose or missing shingles and inspect the flashing around chimneys, vents, and skylights.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Minor repairs:</b> Addressing small issues promptly can prevent them from escalating into more extensive damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                    Your roof plays a critical role in protecting your home, but it can experience wear and tear over time. Here are some common signs that indicate it may be time to call us:
                </p>

                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Leaks or Water Stains:</b> Water stains on ceilings or walls often indicate a roof leak that needs immediate attention. Ignoring leaks can lead to mold growth and structural damage.</li>
